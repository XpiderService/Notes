Why rent an nft?
🚩The problem: Players don't want to risk their capital to test a web3 game.👉
The solution : A rental system that allows players to enjoy the utilities of NFTs without even buying it​Renting NFTs (non-fungible tokens) to test a Web3 game can offer several advantages to players. NFTs are unique digital assets that are used in many Web3 games to represent items, characters, or even virtual land parcels. Here are some key benefits of renting NFTs to test a Web3 game:
1.Cost Savings: When you rent an NFT, you can save money compared to buying an NFT outright. NFTs can often be very expensive, especially if they are rare or in high demand. By renting an NFT, you can test the game without having to pay the full price to own the digital asset.
2.Flexibility: Renting NFTs offers greater flexibility in terms of usage time and asset selection. You can rent an NFT for a short period of time to test the game and then return it without having to worry about storing or managing the digital asset long-term. You can also choose from a variety of different digital assets to find the one that best suits your gameplay style.
3.Ability to test different features: By renting different NFTs, you can test different features and gameplay experiences that each digital asset can offer. For example, you can rent an NFT that provides access to additional customization features, and then rent another NFT that offers unique gameplay advantages.
4.Discover New Games: Renting NFTs can also allow you to discover new games that you may not have otherwise thought to play. By renting an NFT to test a new game, you can explore new virtual worlds, new gameplay mechanics, and new challenges.
Overall, renting NFTs can be a cost-effective and flexible way to test a Web3 game before deciding to buy an NFT or committing long-term. With the ability to test different features and discover new games, renting NFTs can offer a richer and more varied gameplay experience for players.

Challenges of Renting NFT
Renting NFTs (Non-Fungible Tokens) is a relatively new practice in the Web3 gaming ecosystem, but it presents unique challenges for players and developers. NFTs are unique digital assets that allow players to own and control unique virtual objects like weapons, characters, or lands. However, renting these objects can be difficult to manage, due to the complexity of the NFT ecosystem and the risks associated with security and ownership.
The first challenge is related to managing the NFTs themselves. NFTs are unique digital assets that are stored on a blockchain, making them immutable and transparent. This means that players who rent NFTs must be able to reliably and securely transfer ownership of these assets. Developers must therefore put in place robust mechanisms to facilitate the transfer of NFTs between players, while ensuring that current owners cannot abusively retain NFTs once the rental is over.
Another important challenge is related to security. NFTs are high-value digital assets, and their ownership must be protected against theft and fraud. Developers must therefore put in place robust security mechanisms to ensure that rented NFTs cannot be stolen or abused by unauthorized third parties. Players must also be aware of the risks associated with renting NFTs and take measures to protect their digital assets, such as using secure cryptographic wallets and verifying the identities of other players before renting NFTs.
Finally, another major challenge is related to regulation. NFTs are a relatively new area, and there is not yet a clear regulatory framework for their use in Web3 games. Developers must therefore be aware of the legal risks associated with renting NFTs and ensure that their practices comply with applicable laws and regulations. Players must also be aware of the legal risks associated with renting NFTs and take measures to ensure that they comply with applicable laws and regulations.
To overcome these challenges, developers must put in place robust and secure NFT management mechanisms, using technologies like smart contracts and cryptography. They must also be aware of the legal risks associated with renting NFTs and work with lawyers to ensure that their practices comply with applicable laws and regulations. Players must also be aware of the risks associated with renting NFTs and take measures to protect their digital assets and ensure that they comply with applicable laws and regulations. By working together, developers and players can create a safe and secure environment for renting NFTs in Web3 games.

The AMLCO is placed under the direct responsibility of the general Management: AML policy changes and implementation requirements: Each major change of Poker Face Casino website AML policy is subject to be approval by the general management of MIBS NV and the Anti money laundering compliance officer. Three step Verification: Step one verification: Step one verification must be done by every user and customer to withdraw. Regarding of the choice of payment, the amount of payment, the amount of withdraw, the choice of withdraw and nationality of the user/customer step one verification must be done first. Step one verification is a document that must be filled out by the user/customer himself. Following information’s must be filled in: first name, second name, date of birth, country of usual residence, gender and full address. Step two verification: Step two verification must be done by every user which deposit over 2000 EUR (two thousand Euro) or withdraws any amount. Until step two verification is done the withdraw, tip or deposit will be hold. Step to verification will lead the user or customer to a subpage where he must send in his ID. The user/customer must make a picture of his ID. While a paperclip with a six-digit random generated number is next to his ID: Only an official ID may be used for ID verification, depending on the country the variety of accepted IDs may be different. There will also be an electronic check if the filled in Data from the step one verification is correct. The electronic check will check via two different databanks to insure the giveninformation’s matches with the filled document and the name from the ID: If the electronic test fails or is not possible the user/customer is required to send in a conformation of his current resident. A certificate of registration by the government or a similar document is required. Step three verification: Step three verification must be done by every user which deposit over 5000$ (five thousand Dollar) or withdraws over 5000$ (five thousand Dollar) or sends another user over 3000$ (three thousand Dollar) Until step three verification is done the withdraw, tip or deposit will be hold. For step 3 a user/customer will be asked for a source of wealth. Customer identification and verification (KYC) The formal identification of customers on entry into commercial relations is a vital element, both for the regulations relating to money laundering and for the KYC policy. This identification relies on the following fundamental principles: A copy of your passport, ID card or driving license, each shown alongside a handwritten note mentioning six random generated numbers. Also, a second picture with the face of the user/customer is required. The user/customer may blur out every information, besides date of birth, nationality, gender, first name, second name and the picture. To secure their privacy. Please note that all four corners of the ID have to be visible in the same image and all details has to be clearly readable besides the named above. We might ask for all details if necessary. An employee may do additional checks if necessary, based on the situation. Proof of Address: Proof of address will be done via to different electronic checks, which use two different databases. If an electronic test fails, the user/customer has the option to make a manually proof. A recent utility bill sent to your registered address, issued within the last 3 months or an official document made by the government that proofs your state of residence. To make the approval process as speedy as possible, please make sure the document is sent with a clear resolution where all four corners of the document is visible, and all text is readable. For example: An electricity bill, water bill, bank statement or any governmental post addressed to you. An employee may do additional checks if necessary, based on the situation. Source of funds If a player deposits over a five thousand euro there is a process of understandings the source of wealth (SOW) Examples of SOW are: Ownership of business Employment Inheritance Investment Family
It is critical that the origin and legitimacy of that wealth is clearly understood. If this is not possible an employee may ask for an additional document or prove. The account will be frozen if the same user deposits either this amount in one go or multiple transactions which amount to this. An email will be sent to them manually to go through the above and an information on the website itself. Poker Face Casino also asks for a bank wire/credit card to further insure the Identity of the user/customer. It also gives additional information about the financial situation of the user/customer. Basic document for step one: The basic document will be accessible via the setting page on Poker Face Casino. Every user has to fill out the following information: First name Second name Nationality Date of Birth The document will be saved and created by an AI, an employee may do additional checks if necessary based on the situation.
Risk management: In order to deal with the different risks and different states of wealth in different regions on the earth Poker Face Casino will categorize every nation in three different regions of risk. Region one: Low risk: For every nation from the region one the three-step verification is done as described earlier. Region two: Medium risk: For every nation from the region two the three-step verification will be done at lower deposit, withdraw and tip amounts. Step one will be done as usually. Step two will be done after depositing 1000$ (one thousand Dollars), withdrawing 1000$ (one thousand Dollars) or tipping another user/customer 500$ (five hundred Dollars.) Step three will be done after depositing 2500$ (two thousand five hundred Dollars), withdrawing 2500$ (two thousand five hundred Dollars) or tipping another user/customer 1000$ (one thousand Dollars). Also, users from a low risk region that change crypto currency in any other currency will be treated like user/customers from a medium risk region. Region three: High risk: Regions of high risks will be banned. High risk regions will be regularly updated to keep up with the changing environment of a fast-changing world.
Additional measurements. In addition, an AI which is overseen by the AML compliance officer will look for any unusual behaviour and report it right away to a employee of Poker Face Casino. According to a risk based few and general experience the human employees will recheck all checks which are done before by the AI or other employees and may redo or do additional checks according to the situation. In addition, a data Scientist supported by modern, electronic, analytic systems will look for unusual behaviour like: Depositing and withdrawing without longer Betting sessions. Attempts to use a different Bank account to for Deposit and Withdraw, nationality changes, currency changes, behaviour and activity changes as well as checks, if an account is used by it´s original owner. Also a User has to use the same method for Withdraw as he used for Deposit, for the amount of the initial Deposit to prevent any Money Laundering. Enterprise-wide risk assessment As part of its risk-based approach, Poker Face Casino has conducted an AML “Enterprise- wide risk assessment” (EWRA) to identify and understand risks specific to Poker Face Casino and its business lines. The AML risk policy is determined after identifying and documenting the risks inherent to its business lines such as the services the website offers. The Users to whom services are offered, transactions performed by these Users, delivery channels used by the bank, the geographic locations of the bank’s operations, customers and transactions and other qualitative and emerging risks. The identification of AML risk categories is based on Poker Face Casino understanding of regulatory requirements, regulatory expectations and industry guidance. Additional safety measures are taken to take care of the additional risks the world wide web brings with it. The EWRA is yearly reassessed. Ongoing transaction monitoring AML-Compliance ensures that an “ongoing transaction monitoring” is conducted to detect transactions which are unusual or suspicious compared to the customer profile. This transaction monitoring is conducted on two levels:
The first Line of Control: Poker Face Casino works solely with trusted Payment Service Providers whom all have effective AML policies in place as to prevent the large majority of suspicious deposits onto Poker Face Casino from taking place without proper execution of KYC procedures onto the potential customer.
The second Line of Control: Poker Face Casino makes its network aware so that any contact with the customer or player or authorized representative must give rise to the exercise of due diligence on transactions on the account concerned. In particular these include: • Requests for the execution of financial transactions on the account; • Requests in relation to means of payment or services on the account; Also, the three-step verification with adjusted risk management should provide all necessary information’s about all customers of Poker Face Casino at all time. Also, all transaction must be overseen by employees over watched by the AML compliance officer who is over watched by the general management. The specific transactions submitted to the customer support manager, possibly through their Compliance Manager must also be subject to due diligence. Determination of the unusual nature of one or more transactions essentially depends on a subjective assessment, in relation to the knowledge of the customer (KYC), their financial behaviour and the transaction counterparty. These checks will be done by an automated System, while an Employee crosschecks them for additional security. The transactions observed on customer accounts for which it is difficult to gain a proper understanding of the lawful activities and origin of funds must therefore rapidly be considered atypical (as they are not directly justifiable). Any Poker Face Casino staff member must inform the AML division of any atypical transactions which they observe and cannot attribute to a lawful activity or source of income known of the customer.
The third Line of Control: As a last line of defence against AML Poker Face Casino will do manually checks on all suspicious and higher risk users in order to fully prevent money laundering. If fraud or Money Laundering is found the authorities will be informed. Reporting of Suspicious transactions on Poker Face Casino In its internal procedures, Poker Face Casino describes in precise terms, for the attention of its staff members, when it is necessary to report and how to proceed with such reporting. Reports of atypical transactions are analysed within the AML team in accordance with the precise methodology fully described in the internal procedures. Depending on the result of this examination and on the basis of the information gathered, the AML team: will decide whether it is necessary or not to send a report to the FIU, in accordance with the legal obligations provided in the Law of 18 September 2017; will decide whether or not it is necessary to terminate the business relations with the customer. Procedures The AML rules, including minimum KYC standards will be translated into operational guidance or procedures that are available on the Intranet site of Poker Face Casino. Record keeping Records of data obtained for the purpose of identification must be kept for at least ten years after the business relationship has ended. Records of all transaction data must be kept for at least ten years following the carrying-out of the transactions or the end of the business relationship.

With the rise of the Web3 economy, NFTs (non-fungible tokens) have become a popular topic of conversation. These tokens allow digital object owners to prove they are the sole holders of these objects. One of the key advantages of NFTs is that they enable digital objects such as artwork, videos, or music to be turned into unique and valuable digital assets. NFTs can be bought and sold, and there are even NFT rental platforms that allow digital object owners to rent out their NFTs to others. But what is the real potential of NFT rental for generating revenue for digital object owners?
Firstly, NFT rental can enable digital object owners to maximize their revenue. They can rent out their NFTs to multiple people at the same time, which means they can generate recurring revenue over a given period. Additionally, NFT rental can allow digital object owners to reach a wider audience. By renting out their NFT, they can enable others to enjoy their digital object while generating additional revenue.
Furthermore, NFT rental can be particularly appealing to artists and content creators. They can rent out their NFTs to online art galleries or virtual museums, which can give them additional exposure for their work. NFT rental can also be a source of additional income for artists, allowing them to continue to create and sell their work without having to worry about finding new buyers for each piece.
However, it is important to note that NFT rental can be a complex area. Firstly, digital object owners need to be aware of the risks associated with renting out their NFTs, particularly around ownership and legal liability. Additionally, NFT rental may also be subject to complex tax and regulatory rules, which can vary depending on the jurisdiction.
In conclusion, NFT rental offers interesting benefits for digital object owners who are looking to generate additional revenue in the Web3 economy. By renting out their NFTs, they can reach a wider audience and generate recurring revenue over a given period. However, it is important for digital object owners to be aware of the risks associated with NFT rental and to research the applicable tax and regulatory rules in their jurisdiction.

Renting or Buying?
With the advent of Web3 games, digital assets such as Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) have taken a central place in the economy of these games. NFTs are unique digital assets that can represent any type of digital content, such as digital artwork, game skins, or even virtual real estate. In the world of Web3 games, NFTs can be purchased directly or rented for a predetermined period. In this article, we will examine the differences between renting NFTs and buying them directly, as well as situations where renting may be preferable.
Firstly, direct purchase of an NFT can be advantageous if you are looking to own the digital asset permanently. Direct purchase means that you get full ownership of the digital asset and can use it as you wish. You can sell it later, give it to someone else, or keep it for yourself. However, direct purchase can be expensive, especially if the digital asset in question is rare or highly coveted.
On the other hand, renting an NFT can be a more affordable and convenient option if you are looking to use the digital asset for a limited period of time. Renting allows players to use the digital asset for a predetermined period of time, for a rental fee. This can be useful if you don't have the financial means to buy the digital asset in question, or if you only need to use it for a short period.
Additionally, renting an NFT can be advantageous if you are looking to test out a digital asset before purchasing it. Renting an NFT allows you to see how it behaves in the game and determine if it's worth buying in the long run. This can be particularly useful if you are looking to buy a rare or expensive NFT and want to make sure it's a good investment before spending money on it.
Finally, renting an NFT may also be preferable in situations where full ownership of the digital asset is not necessary or desired. For example, if you are looking to use an NFT for a single occasion, such as a special event or unique game occasion, renting may be more convenient than direct purchase. Similarly, if you are simply looking to customize your game character for a short period, renting may be a more suitable option for your needs.
In conclusion, renting and direct purchase of NFTs are both viable options for Web3 game players. Direct purchase can be advantageous if you are looking to own the digital asset permanently, while renting may be more convenient and affordable if you only need to use it for a limited period. Whatever your choice, it's important to understand the pros and cons.

Introduction
Evolution of Online Gambling
Online gambling has grown a lot in the last ten years. It used to be a small thing, but now it's a huge industry worth billions of dollars. Thanks to new technology, online casinos can now offer experiences that are just as good, if not better, than traditional casinos. But as online gambling has gotten bigger, it's faced some problems. Traditional online casinos can be slow and expensive to use, and sometimes people worry that they're not fair. This has made some people trust them less, and it's made it clear that we need to make online gambling more transparent, secure, and efficient.
2.2 Cryptocurrency: The New Frontier in Online Gambling
2.2.1 Inherent Benefits of Cryptocurrency
Cryptocurrency can help with a lot of these problems because it's decentralized, transparent, and easy to use:
Transparency and Trustworthiness: When you make a bet with cryptocurrency, it gets recorded on something called a blockchain, which can't be changed. This makes it harder for online casinos to cheat you. Speed and Cost-effectiveness: Cryptocurrency transactions are usually faster and cheaper than regular bank transactions, which means you can play more without spending as much money. Accessibility and Inclusivity: Anyone with an internet connection can use cryptocurrency, even if they live in a place where it's hard to use regular banks. This means more people can play online games.
2.2.2 Challenges and Opportunities
Using cryptocurrency for online gambling isn't perfect, though. There are some problems:
Volatility: The value of cryptocurrency can change a lot, which might worry some people. Regulatory Concerns: Some countries haven't made rules about using cryptocurrency for gambling yet, so it's not always clear what's allowed and what's not. But these problems also give us chances to do better. If we can find ways to deal with the risks of cryptocurrency and follow the rules, we can make online gambling even better.
2.3 The Power of Telegram as a Platform
2.3.1 Beyond Messaging: Telegram’s Potential
Telegram isn't just for sending messages:
Built for Mobile: You can use Telegram on your phone easily, which makes it great for using Poker Face Bets on the go. Telegram Bots: These are like little apps inside Telegram that can do all kinds of things, like help you play games or manage your account. Community Building: You can join groups on Telegram where you can talk to other people who use Poker Face Bets, which helps build trust and make friends.
2.3.2 Security and Scalability
Telegram takes security seriously:
End-to-end encryption: This means your messages and transactions are kept private. Scalability: Telegram can handle lots of messages and transactions, so it won't slow down as more people start using Poker Face Bets.
2.4 Introducing Poker Face Bets
Poker FaceBets is a new way to gamble online that uses cryptocurrency and Telegram to make things better. We've made our token called $PF which gives you rewards and lets you share in our success. We want to change how online gambling works for the better.

Staking Rewards
7.1 Overview Poker Face Bets boasts an expansive system for rewarding $PF holders, particularly those who choose to stake their tokens. Staking has evolved into a compelling method to encourage prolonged holding and active participation within a cryptocurrency ecosystem. For Poker Face Bets, staking $PF serves not only to enhance token stability and nurture community loyalty but also provides stakeholders with passive rewards, amplifying the advantages of being integral to the ecosystem.
7.2 Basics of Staking $PF
7.2.1 What is Staking? Staking involves locking up a designated amount of $PF within the platform for a predetermined duration. In return, stakers receive rewards in the form of additional $PF tokens, and in the 6-month locked pool, Ethereum is also earned as a reward—essentially earning interest on their staked amount.
7.2.2 Why Stake $PF? Staking presents numerous benefits:
Copy
Passive Rewards: Earn rewards in the form of additional $PFC tokens and Ethereum (6 Month Pool).
Enhanced Platform Loyalty Bonuses: Stakers enjoy preferential treatment in terms of bonuses, offers, or game access.
Supporting the Ecosystem: By temporarily reducing the circulating supply, staking contributes to token price stability and increases.
7.3 How Rewards are Distributed Rewards are calculated based on the staked amount and duration. They can be claimed at any time through the website and utilized in the casino, restaked, or stored in the wallet. At the end of the staking period, the initial staked tokens plus any unclaimed rewards are available for retrieval using the staker's wallet.
7.3.1 Staking Locking Period When adding tokens to the staking pool, they are locked for the duration shown in the pool. There are three pools: 10 days, 3 months, and 6 months. Adding extra tokens behaves differently in each pool:
Copy
10 Day Pool: Adding extra tokens restarts the 10-day lock period.
3 Month Pool: Adding extra tokens does NOT extend the lock period.
6 Month Pool: Adding extra tokens does NOT extend the lock period. Rewards accrued during this time can be claimed, used in the casino, kept in the wallet, or restaked to compound holdings.
7.4 Security and Trust
Copy
Smart Contract Assurance: Staking is governed by smart contracts, ensuring transparency and preventing malicious activities.
Periodic Audits: Regular audits of the staking contract maintain security and integrity.
Withdrawal Assurance: While tokens are locked, stakers are assured of receiving their staked amount plus rewards at the end of the term.
7.5 Reinforced Ecosystem Engagement Beyond immediate financial rewards, staking $PFC entitles members to:
Copy
Exclusive Access: Stakers gain first-hand access to new games, features, or promotional events.
Community Recognition: Recognizing top stakers fosters healthy competition and further engagement.
7.5 When you add tokens to the staking pool, they will be locked for the time shown in the pool. 

There are 3 pools: 10 days, 3 Months and 6 Months. If you add any extra tokens to the pool either through restaking or adding tokens from another source such as buying them from the open market or winnings from the casino, the pools behave slightly differently.
10 Day Pool - adding extra tokens restarts the 10 day lock period.
3 Month Pool - adding extra tokens does NOT add extra time.
6 Month Pool - adding extra tokens does NOT add extra time.
Rewards that are accrued in that time however can be claimed at any time and can be used in the casino, kept in your wallet or restaked to compound your holdings.
7.6 Conclusion Poker Face Bets staking rewards system underscores its commitment to rewarding the community and ensuring platform sustainability. By providing tangible benefits for holding and staking $PF, it solidifies its position as a platform that genuinely values its stakeholders

Testing Before Buying
In the world of Web3 gaming, NFTs have become an essential part of the gaming experience. NFTs are unique digital objects that are recorded on the blockchain, giving them an unquestionable value and authenticity. NFTs are often used to represent characters, objects, or equipment in the game, and can be bought, sold, or traded between players.
However, it can be difficult for players to decide which NFTs to buy, especially if they are expensive or have a significant impact on gameplay. This is where NFT renting can come in handy.
NFT renting allows players to rent a digital object for a set period of time, usually a few hours or days. During this time, the player can use the digital object as if they owned it, allowing them to test its features and benefits in the game. If the player decides they want to keep the digital object, they can then purchase it at the end of the rental period.
NFT renting offers several benefits to players. Firstly, it allows them to try out different characters or objects before buying, enabling them to make more informed purchasing decisions. Players can discover how different characters or objects affect gameplay and whether they suit their play style, without having to invest in an expensive NFT from the outset.
Additionally, NFT renting can also encourage players to try out objects they may not have considered otherwise. For example, a player may be hesitant to buy a digital object if they are unsure of its usefulness or potential value. By renting the object, the player can test it out risk-free and discover its benefits and drawbacks.
Ultimately, NFT renting can offer players a more satisfying and personalized gaming experience. Players can test out different characters or objects, discover new features, and improve their gameplay before making a purchasing decision. This can help players maximize their time and money in Web3 games, while enhancing their overall gaming experience.
